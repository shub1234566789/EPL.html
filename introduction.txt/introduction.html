    HTML (HyperText Markup Language) is the foundational language used to create and structure content on the web. It defines the elements and layout of a webpage, allowing browsers to display text, images, links, and other multimedia content.

<h1>HTML is a markup language, not a programming language. It uses a system of tags to annotate text, indicating how it should appear or behave on a webpage. These tags help browsers understand the structure and presentation of the content</h1>




<!DOCTYPE html>: Declares the document type and version of HTML.

<html>: The root element that contains all other HTML elements.

<head>: Contains meta-information about the document, like the title and links to stylesheets.

<title>: Sets the title of the webpage, displayed in the browser's title bar or tab.

<body>: Contains the content of the webpage, such as text, images, and links.
